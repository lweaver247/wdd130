            <h2><em>Our Why</em></h2>
             <p>We have been there before. Wanting to ask that interesting girl or boy out but don’t want to go on the 100th frozen yogurt date. We wanted to try something new, but we weren’t the most original thinkers. We asked friends for date ideas, and they send us “100 free date ideas.” They are helpful, but we skipped many fun activities because they were unfamiliar to us and seemed time consuming. We had busy lives, and we don’t want to go through the trouble of figuring out on our own how to put them together.<br><br>

                That’s why we created Date Book.<br><br>
        
                 It is a recipe book for dates.<br><br>
        
                 Unlike usual lists of date ideas, we added in the steps and materials needed to organize each date idea. We also provide recommendations to local stores and sites to purchase materials and host activities.<br><br>
        
                 Now you can be more confident asking your date to go cross-country skiing because you know where to go and how to put it together.<br><br>
