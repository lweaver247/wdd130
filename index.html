    <p>I am excited to be learning web development with you all. 
        I am studying Interdisciplinary Studies 
        with an emphasis in Marriage and Family Studies.
    </p>
    <p> I want to operate and found my own nonproft
        organizations in the arts and culture sector. Having an engaging website is critical to draw patrons,
        but many new nonprofits don't have websites or they are poorly designed. 
        I am taking this course to understand the fundamental coding and technical
        language in designing websites so I can assist other nonprofits in building theirs.
    </p>
    <p> I love being creative and intellectual. I play multiple instruments. 
        I love to cook, draw, watch TV (Currently <em>Downton Abby</em>), and solve logic and word puzzles. 
        I'm still single (for anyone interested).
    <p>Most of all, I love being a disciple of Jesus Christ. 
        It is as intellectually stimulating as it is faith promoting. I have a deep, real testimony
        of Jesus Christ and His Atonement and His plan of redemption. 
        I am well versed in the scriptures, so if you need a 
        scripture reference, 90% of the time I can tell you where it is at. 
        I am excited to get to know you more this semester!
